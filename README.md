# Coding Rules:

* All variables and functions names should use camelCase convention.
* Use comments.
* Do not repeat the code, instead you should wrap repeated code in a function.
* Make the statement readable. To make the statement readable,
  keep the line short so you donâ€™t need to scroll horizontally to read the complete line.
* Stick to the mentioned file names conventions when adding a new file.
